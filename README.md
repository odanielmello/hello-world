# hello-world
This is my first repository.
Back in 2017, when I created this account, started the tutorial but never finished.
That's why I consider I made a *pause* and now, 5 years later, I'm still beginning wit Github.

Already a Telecommunications Engineer for 16 years, I am studying Software Engineering (started this new bachelor graduation this year, 2022), studying consistently the following subjects:
* Python
* C and C++
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and some React)

I'll see you in the next update.
